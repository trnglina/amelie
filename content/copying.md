This site, its code, and all its content, are licensed freely for anyone to modify and redistribute with few restrictions. Does this mean you could download the entire site, upload it somewhere else, and call it your own? Not quiteâ€”the purpose of this page is to make clear what you _can_ and _cannot_ do.

## Code

This site is generated from source using the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is licensed under the permissive [Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/LICENSE). This site does not distribute, modify, or require modifying Hugo, its source code, or its binaries, in any way.

The source code of this site is even more permissive, with the majority of the code ([javascript](https://i.imgflip.com/2kuh6f.jpg) scripts, [sass](https://i.imgur.com/PaTi4l8.png) stylesheets, and [html](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXy3Qt5V4AAD3S1.jpg) templates) dedicated to the public domain through the [CC0 1.0 Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0). That means if you wanted to use any of those resources in your own site, (in many jurisdictions)[^1] you're free to copy it straight into your own code; no credit or a second thought needed. In fact, not only _can_ you do this legally, I've made it easy: all of these files are [published online](https://github.com/trnglina/amelie), in their original (non-minimised) forms, and easily browsable.

Everything in the folders `/scripts`, `/sass`, `/layouts`, and `/archetypes` are public-domain.

You are provided with **no patent or trademark grants or licenses**.

You are provided with **no warranty whatsoever**.

## Assets and content

You still have the right to modify, share, and redistribute the content, but unlike the code, you must both _give appropriate credit_, and _license your changes under the same license_.[^2]

The [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) applies to everything in the folders `/static/images` and `/content`.

You may **copy, modify, and distribute**, even for commercial purposes, so long as you:

- Indicate if changes were made; and
- Distribute any derivatives under the same license.

You **may not** apply legal terms or technological measures to **restrict the rights to others** granted by the license.

You are provided with **no warranty whatsoever**.

## Third party licenses

Inevitably, someone else's code is find its way in here as well. This site uses and distributes the following third-party content:
