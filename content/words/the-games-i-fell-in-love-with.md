Today is Christmas day, but it's also the day the [remastered *Atelier Dusk* trilogy](http://www.gamecity.ne.jp/atelier/duskdx/) releases in Japan. These things may seem unrelated--and indeed, they are--but it just so happened I had a little extra time to write on Christmas day, and that particular game series was the topic I most wanted to write about. Truly a convenient coincidence[^1].

I'm writing about video games, even though it's been quite a few years since I played games *seriously*--and I mean serious. There's this minority of consumers who consider themselves, and are considered, *hardcore gamers*, and I used to consider myself among them. I would get into arguments with people about why their favourite games were lesser than mine, obsessively peruse the steam sales and [/r/gamedeals](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedeals), and spend an exuberant amount of money on computing hardware. I even had a blossoming penchant for game criticism--which I've mostly nipped by now.

You see, my relationship with that world was already fading by the time I played forty hours straight of [*Atelier Lydie & Suelle*](https://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/lydieandsuelle/)--a game that, when mentioned, gets me an equal number of uncomfortable looks from hardcore and casual gamers alike--but my wholehearted *love* for that game firmly shut that door behind me.

Here's the thing with the *Atelier* series: you've probably never heard of it. And if you have, it's probably either from me (you're welcome), or because of the newest instalment, [*Atelier Ryza*](https://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/ryza/) which has gathered a little more steam than the series usually does--more on this later. Indeed, before [*Atelier Sophie*](https://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/sophie/) released on Steam, the first *Atelier* game to release on PC, I didn't know there was a single *Atelier* game, much less [*twenty-one*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelier_(video_game_series)) of them!

## Charm explosion

[^1]: One could even call it a Christmas miracle.

[^2]: And even if you look at some fairly of the more recent instalments, you could still probably convince yourself that you were playing a PlayStation 2 game. It's truly an astonishing dedication to nostalgia; well, either that, or an astonishing lack of publisher subsidisation for graphical and mechanical improvements.
